# PrediBici
Project carried out as part of an innovation week at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon.

This educational project focused on the ergonomics of deploying a network of self-service bicycles in Mexico City. The idea developed here is to retrieve raw data available in open source as CSV files on the website <a href="url">https://www.ecobici.cdmx.gob.mx</a>, then to exploit them. 

The raw data are signals sent by the city's self-service bicycle stations to a server. These signals contain the information :
<ul>
  <li>user's gender (M or F)</li>
  <li>user's age</li>
  <li>bike's ID</li>
  <li>bikes station of departure ID</li>
  <li>departure date</li>
  <li>departure time</li>
  <li>bikes station of arrival ID</li>
  <li>arrival date</li>
  <li>arrival time</li>
</ul>
